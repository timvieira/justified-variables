Justified Variables
===================

I like it when my source code lines up nicely, don't you?

This document is here to
```
help
make
your
code
look
nice
```

Let's put an end to ugly pairings, such as `open/close`, `alpha/beta`,
`vertex/edge`. Let's see more of `open/shut`, `node/edge`, `push/pull`!

These typographic constraints can make coding feel like a crossword puzzle.

`justified variables` are clusters of related words of the same length
(`justified` in fixed-width font). We're particularly interested in word
clusters with contrasting meanings, part-whole, antonyms, and frequently
associated programming / math jargon (`variables`). Standard abbreviations are
gladly accepted.
